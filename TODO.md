TODO:

"Add Word to Line" Button (see page 37 of Chile Nitrate Fields, the * isn't being captured by detection)

- Break "Sidenotes" off as their own paragraph.
    add logic to put these somewhere in the OCR (top for left sidenotes, bottom for right sidenotes)


Rematch bboxes using new padding for detection algorithim.

Already did page 9 of from magic to science

Add additional logic to attempt to auto-fix the bottoms of the bboxes which seem to overflow frequently.

Add ability to label a word as in Italics, Bold, Blackletter

"All Lines" is refreshing itself after Go To Page # a second time
