[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1mscript [22mmakes a typescript of everything on your terminal session. The terminal data are stored in raw form to the log file and information about timing to another (optional) structured log file. The timing log file is necessary to replay the[m
       session later by [1mscriptreplay[22m(1) and to store additional information about the session.[m
[m
       Since version 2.35, [1mscript [22msupports multiple streams and allows the logging of input and output to separate files or all the one file. This version also supports a new timing file which records additional information. The command [1mscriptreplay[0m[m
       [1m--summary [22mthen provides all the information.[m
[m
       If the argument [4mfile[24m or option [1m--log-out [4m[22mfile[24m is given, [1mscript [22msaves the dialogue in this [4mfile[24m. If no filename is given, the dialogue is saved in the file [4mtypescript[24m.[m
[m
       Note that logging input using [1m--log-in [22mor [1m--log-io [22mmay record security-sensitive information as the log file contains all terminal session input (e.g., passwords) independently of the terminal echo flag setting.[m

       It is not recommended to run [1mscript [22min non-interactive shells. The inner shell of [1mscript [22mis always interactive, and this could lead to unexpected results. If you use [1mscript [22min the shell initialization file, you have to avoid entering an[m
       infinite loop. You can use for example the [1m.profile [22mfile, which is read by login shells only:[m
[m
           if test -t 0 ; then[m
               script[m
               exit[m
           fi[m
[m
       You should also avoid use of [1mscript [22min command pipes, as [1mscript [22mcan read more input than you would expect.[m
